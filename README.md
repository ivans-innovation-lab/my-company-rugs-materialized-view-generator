# my-company-rugs-materialized-view-generator


This [Rug][rug] project contains a generator for a [Spring Boot][boot]
query side API.

[rug]: http://docs.atomist.com/

## Rugs

Rugs are typically run using the Atomist Bot in Slack. To run Rugs
locally, you must first install the following tools:

-   [Rug CLI][rug-cli]
-   [Node.js][node]

[rug-cli]: http://docs.atomist.com/user-guide/interfaces/cli/install/
[node]: https://nodejs.org/

Once those tools are installed, you can clone this repository and
install its dependencies with the following command.

```
$ ( cd .atomist && npm install )
```

You can install your archive locally
```
$ rug install
```
and/or publish to remote 'atomist' repositories

```
Slack: @atomist team (you should find YOUR_TOKEN in Slack response)
$ rug publish --id=YOUR_TOKEN
```

### NewQuerySideProject

The NewQuerySideProject generator creates a new [Spring
Boot][boot] project for the query side.

[boot]: https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/

#### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to running this generator.

#### Parameters

To run this generator you must supply the following parameters.

Name | Required | Default | Description
-----|----------|---------|------------
Project Name | Yes | |  A valid GitHub repository name.  It should be 21 characters or less to avoid truncating name when the its Slack channel is created.
`aggregateName` | Yes | Aggregate name | Aggregate class name, e.g., "Blog".
`version` | No | 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT | [Semantic version][semver] of the project.
`description` | No | My new project | A brief description of the project.

[semver]: http://semver.org

#### Running

Run it as follows:

```
$ cd parent/directory
$ rug generate my-company-rugs:query-side-project-generator:NewQuerySideProject \
    my-company-customer-materialized-view \
    aggregateName=Customer \
    version=0.1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    description="Query Side - Customer"
```

Note the first parameter, the project name, is different in that you
do not need to supply the name of the parameter, just the value.  This
is because the project name parameter is required for all generators.
This will create a directory named `my-company-customer-materialized-view` and populate it
with a simple event listener.  If you are happy with the
change, commit the changes.

```
$ cd my-company-customer-materialized-view
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial version generated by Atomist generator'
```

See the README in the generated project for further instructions.
